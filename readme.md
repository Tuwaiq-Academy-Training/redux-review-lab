# Redux Lab

You need to complete your instagram application to work in a redux state management way (since our application is quite large)

The requirement are as follows:

1- you need to reconstruct your application so that it does not use "usestate" ever, and only uses the given options from redux (useSelector and useDispatcher)   
2- you need to have a functioning like button for each post   
3- you need to complete the entire CRUD (on memory) for all the posts
